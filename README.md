# GL capturing for OBS

## How to use:

Install SimpleScreenRecorder for the `ssr-glinject` script and libraries.  
Compile and place this plugin in /usr/lib/obs-plugins.  
Run a game with `ssr-glinject game-command`.  
Add the "GL Source" to your OBS sources. It should pick up the game window.

_This project is experimental._
